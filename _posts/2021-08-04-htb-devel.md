## Intro

I finally decided to get serious about doing the OSCP. My work colleagues have been harping on me for a while now about doing it, and I really don't have any reason not to.  Community consensus seems to be that TJNull's list of ["OSCP-like"](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html#vulnerable-machines) boxes is excellent prep. So I figured I'd start with that. Its broken down by Linux and Windows. I always feel more comfortable on Linux than I do Windows, so I'm going to start doing all the Windows ones first.

## Reconnaissance

### Initial Scan

I'm going to modify my initial reconnoitre scan this time around, by adding the ```--quick``` flag.. I've noticed the repo has aged a bit and I've had some follow on tool failures during automated scans, so I'm going to manually do service enumerations after it does its scans.

```bash
reconnoitre -t 10.129.193.22 -o . --services --quick
```

### Scan Results

## Enumeration

### Initial Assessments

Based on our results we have a few interesting things we can derive about the box immediately:
- Its most likely a Windows 2008 R2 server based on the [Microsoft IIS versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services)
- It is hosting a web server
- Its hosting a FTP server
- The FTP server does allow anonymous login

### HTTP

I generally tend to start with web servers first, as they may yield OSINT or other harvestable information about the target that will be valuable. Browsing to the target webserver displays a default config IIS splash with no interesting HTML source when viewed. Nothing too exciting.

![Web Server Homepage](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_web_server_homepage.png)

If the box potentially is a default configured IIS server, I'd like to directory crawl it to see if there are any misconfigured goodies potentially available. ```gobuster``` is generally my preferred tool for something like this.

```bash
gobuster dir -url http://10.129.183.22:80/ -s '200,204,301,207,403,500' -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -e | tee ./gobuster_10.129.183.22.txt
```

This runs gobuster in directory mode against the target, scanning for returns only on the HTTP return codes we specified, and using the word list we specified. You can arguably use ```directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt``` as well, but it'll take a lot longer and I have a low expectation of success given the configuration. If we see something potentially interesting, I may rescan more in-depth.
- Side Note: I'm a huge believer in piping my output to a file, when using tools. I don't like to rely on the terminal to as a reference. If you accidentally close your session and you aren't logging, or you do something output intensive, referencing your tool output is super annoying. I like having it in a file I can always pull up. ```tee``` accomplishes this for me with tools that don't have output direction flags.

![Gobuster Results](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_gobuster_results.png)

As I kind of suspected, we don't find much of anything exciting; a directory structure that returned ```HTTP 301```, which is forbidden, anyways.

I'm not super experienced with IIS 7.5, so I'd like to try a bit more enumeration with ```nikto``` and see if there's anything I'm potentially missing.

```bash
nikto -host 10.129.193.22 -port 80 -output nikto_10.129.193.22_80.txt
```

Results from nikto (which I failed to screenshot, because I suck), return that its basically a default configured IIS 7.5 webserver. Nothing of note.

At this point I'm going to set aside HTTP and look at FTP, as it seems to have a lot more potential juice in it, considering the scan results.

### FTP

We already know the server has anonymous log in available, but I want to see if there are any other potential vulnerabilities at play here before I jump that down that glaring rabbit hole.

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn -vv -p21 --script=ftp-bounce,ftp-libopie,ftp-proftpd-backdoor,ftp-syst,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221 -oA '10.129.193.22/scans/10.129.193.22_21_ftp' 10.129.193.22
```

The results show no, just the anonymous FTP. Let's log in.

```bash
ftp 10.129.193.22
```
- Enter ```anonymous``` as the user name and leave the password blank

![Anonymous FTP Login](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_ftp_anon_login.png)

Well, we're in! Not only are we in, but we appear to be at the wwwroot, based on the files we can see. The first thing I always want to know as an anonymous user is, can I upload? You can witness in the screenshot above, me uploading an empty ```test.txt``` file to see if it goes through.

## Exploitation

### Initial Assessment

With the ability to upload as the anonymous FTP user, we have the ability to deliver files to the webroot of the target, a web shell is a viable option here. There are plenty of great asp/aspx web shells on the web, but I usually just generate mine with ```msfvenom```.

### Web Shell Payload Generation

![Web Shell Generation](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_web_shell_generate.png)

This command is:
- Generating a reverse TCP shell payload
- Setting the callback to our attack platform on port 4443
- Setting the format to be aspx since we are delivering this to an IIS Web Server
- Outputting it all to a file named ```cargo.aspx```

### Web Shell Delivery

Time to upload it to the target.

![Web Shell Delivery](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_web_shell_deliver.png)

### Web Shell Execution

Now to setup our listener to catch the callback, in an fresh terminal session:
```bash
nc -nvlp 4443
```

After that, we just have to use our browser to ```http://10.129.193.22/cargo.aspx``` to launch the shell.

### Shell

And we have shell.

![Devel Shell Catch](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_shell_catch.png)

## Post-Exploitation

### Initial Assessments

Whenever I get a shell, I always immediately want to know where I landed and who I landed as. Based on the screenshot above, you can see from the ```whoami``` and the ```ipconfig``` that I am on the intended target and I am the **IIS APPPOOL\WEB** user. This user is going to be very restricted in terms of what it can access (definitely not the user and root flags), but let's run a bit more box enumeration before we start looking at privesc, with ```systeminfo```.

A couple of interesting points:
- Not a 2008 R2 box, but a Windows 7 Enterprise one
- x64 Processor but x86 based PC
- Build 7600
  
## Privilege Escalation

### Initial Assessments

We are going to need a lot more enumeration and information about this box before we even start thinking about slinging privesc attacks at it. winPEASs from the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts Suite](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) is my usual go to for something like there. There are, of course, tons of other available tools you can use, I've just found this one to be consistent, low maintenance, easy to deploy and above all, maintained. 

### winPEAS

Let's put winPEAS on the target via our anonymous FTP access.

```bash
┌──(nullprism㉿granite)-[~/htb/devel/10.129.193.22/exploit]
└─$ cp /opt/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/winPEAS/winPEASexe/binaries/x86/Release/winPEASx86.exe .
```

From there, we'll attempt to execute from our web shell. Maybe you'll have different luck, but I was ultimately unable to get the x86 to execute on the target, so I swapped to the ```.bat``` version of winPEAS, uploaded it via FTP and executed it without issue on the target.

### winPEAS Results

winPEAS will tell you *a lot of things*. In this particular case, we are most interested in this section of the output. Its a list of all the missing patches on the system and potential vulnerabilities associated with them.

```

### Finding a PrivEsc

We can just start at the top with [MS11-080](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2011/ms11-080), related to the ```afd.sys``` vector.

Time to search for viable exploits or POCs via the ```exploitdb```.

```bash
searchsploit afd.sys
```

We actually find two viable POCs, written in C. Upon research, it appears [MS11-046](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2011/ms11-046), which is an earlier version of the same vulnerability is probably more appropriate for our use case, as the POC code specifically references being tested with the specific build of our target machine.

![POC Header Target List](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_poc_privesc_targets.png)

Use ```searchsploit``` to pull this code for further use (also hosted on [my github](https://github.com/nullprism/htb-boxes) in case you need to review it):
```bash
searchsploit -m 40564
```

### Building the PrivEsc

According to the directions in the source, we need to compile the code with our linux host for windows with the following command:

```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc MS11-046.c -o MS11-046.exe -lws2_32
```

Based on some research, I'll need to install the ```mingw-w64``` package on my AP in order to accomplish this.

```bash
sudo apt install mingw-w64
```

After that, compiling seems to go off without a hitch, and no warnings/errors.

### Deliver the PrivEsc & FTP Quicks

All that remains is to use the FTP vector to push the freshly compiled exploit to the target and then use the web shell to execute it.

![Deliver PrivEsc](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_ftp_binary_mode.png)

Side Note:
- This is something learned the hard way previously in my career. If you are going to upload a binary via FTP, make sure you put the FTP session in ```binary``` transfer mode first. Or your upload will succeed, but never execute and you won't know why. You'll then pull your hair out for hours. Save your hair, and your time....and your sanity.

### Execute PrivEsc

![Execute Privesc](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_privesc_execute.png)

```whoami```? I am ROOT. Well, **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**. Let's grab flags!

## Flags

![User Flag](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_user_flag.png)

![Root Flag](/assets/img/htb/devel/devel_root_flag.png)
