## Intro

So I finally decided to get serious about doing the OSCP. My work colleagues have been harping on me for a while now about doing it, and I really don't have any reason not to.  Community consensus seems to be that TJNull's list of ["OSCP-like"](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html#vulnerable-machines) boxes is excellent prep. So I figured I'd start with that. Its broken down by Linux and Windows. I always feel more comforatble on Linux than I do Windows, so I'm going to start doing all the Windows ones first.
